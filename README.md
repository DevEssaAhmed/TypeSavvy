 By default browsers does not understand TypeScript so for that it must be compiled into JavaScript
To install TypeScript run the following

```
    npm i typescript -D
```

This will install TypeScript alongwith it's Compiler and create a node_modules folder.
Now you have to create TypeScript config by running

```
npx tsc --init
```

Now you can write your code in TypeScript using the **ts** extension then you have to run the TypeScript compiler to compile it

```
npx tsc file_name.ts
```

The modern day packaging tools or bundlers like Parcel, WebPack and Vite have the ability to automatically compile TypeScript
